# Diary example

Example of a calender that can easily be non-js compatible and configurable.

## To do

- Create CSS vars to allow it to be configurable
- Add overflow to the table cells
- Overall cleanup of CSS and JS
- Think more about the non-JS fallback (Event ID's that can be passed to server etc)
- Unit tests
- Typescript types
- Modify classes
  - Only show mon-fri
  - Show sunday column first
  - Control height
- Add secondary controllers like next and previous months
- Dark mode support
- Container queries to control th content (M -> Mon -> Monday)
- Container queries to control event titles in the td
- Hide empty row
- Create JS functions to populate the HTML from single div
- JS save callback
- td mutation observers to highlight change
- Allow for extending the dialog options for extra input fields
- Dialog needs required fields and form validation set
- td hover state to highlight adding/editing
- Event List view
- Order event list by date
- Different views (day, week, work week, year)
- Drag an drop
- Event overlapping days
- Repeating events
- Blocked days
- Add times to events
